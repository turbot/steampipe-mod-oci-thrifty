# Oracle Cloud Thrifty Mod

Be Thrifty on Oracle Cloud! This mod checks for unused resources and opportunities to optimize your spend on Oracle Cloud.

## References

[Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com) is a deep and broad platform of public cloud services that enables customers to build and run a wide range of applications in a scalable, secure, highly available, and high-performance environment.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Steampipe Mods](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources#mod) are collections of `named queries`, and codified `controls` that can be used to test current configuration of your cloud resources against a desired configuration.
